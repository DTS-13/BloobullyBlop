BloobullyBlop 0.0.1 Hasn't Been Released Yet.

# BloobullyBlop #

## ___About___ ##

BloobullyBlop is a Python program that can do many tasks by using voice input. It can tell you the weather, tell you the current time and date, play Youtube videos, and more. It is meant to be an easier alternative to having an expensive voice command program like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.

## ___How to use___ ##

BloobullyBlop runs as any other Python file, so once you have installed the Python environment on your computer and all the dependencies of BloobullyBlop, you just use your terminal command for Python and run "BloobullyBlop.py".\
\
The program waits for you to say "Command" for most voice prompts, but there are a few that can be said beforehand.\
You can view the complete guide here: <http://blueberrypie.neocities.org/bloobullyblop/guide.html> 

## ___Note about Dependencies___: ##
There are a few dependencies not in the requirements.txt file. This is because they are modules not available with pip, apt-get, etc. They are available in the repository for download. Just make sure they are on the right path for your Python environment to access.\

___Most of the modules will be automatically installed when you run the file (except for the special ones stated above). This is just in case they don't.___
